Airflow Crypto BTC

Educational pipeline built with Apache Airflow to orchestrate the daily extraction of Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices, compute key metrics, and generate reports.
This project demonstrates how to design, containerize, and run an end-to-end data pipeline using modern data engineering practices.

ðŸ“Œ Features

Dockerized Airflow stack with Postgres backend (webserver, scheduler, triggerer).

Daily DAG (dag_btc_daily) that:

Extracts intraday BTC prices from the Binance API.

Loads data into a SQLite/Postgres database.

Computes OHLC (open, high, low, close) values per day.

Derives financial indicators:

ret: daily log return.

ma7, ma30: 7- and 30-day moving averages.

vol30: 30-day rolling volatility.

Clean project structure with incremental commits for learning.
